I drive customer growth and expansion while making valuable engineering contributions to the wider customer base. In the last two quarters of 22' I generated ~400k in expansion based new revenue.

As the first member of the Field Engineering team, I have been instrumental in growing the team to four members and establishing the foundation for the wider solutions engineering team.

I lead educating our clients and the community at large by regularly creating educational for various Roboflow channels. 

Through computer vision engineering and customer facing skills, I have made a significant impact on the development and growth of Roboflow and the lives of our customers!
