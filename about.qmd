Hi and welcome to the ogjaylowe blog! 

I created this as a way to organize and share my learnings with the wider world. Check out my [first post for more details on what I'm aiming to achieve with my writing](./posts/The Sovereign Tech Dad/index.qmd).

As the first member of the [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) Field Engineering team, I have been instrumental in growing the team to four members and establishing the foundation for the wider solutions engineering team.

At work I drive customer growth and expansion while making valuable engineering contributions to the wider customer base. In the last two quarters of 22' I generated ~400k in expansion based new revenue.

Outside of work, I focus on building a great family, training in the gym, and exploring the wider world of AI x market sector intersections. 

Check out my work on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ogjaylowe), or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/ogjaylowe!
