## Series Ideas
- "How To" focused on doing what I'm learning. Typically in two parts, (1) being a learning series on my blog about the apriori concepts following other works and (2) being a cross post to Roboflow in which I put the learning into action.
    - EX: recreating the monte carlo portion of a RL learning with CV included
    - EX: how to create an openAI gym env and then making one with CV
    - often includes a series in which problem statements get resolved further in each post
        - EX: start with problem statement 1, the work done to validate that, and a link to the next post which will further refine the problem statement and a hypothesis to what that will be (in next post respond to hypothesis)
        - EX: could also be a hypothesis statement on the future of events if an oped type piece
    - include notes and remarks on interview prep and how readers could use these learned lessons from a cut tech vet
- Problems I would like to see solved by others?
- General lessons learned at certain milestones
    - father hood and homeschooling major milestones (birthdays, moves, "first of"-type events, pregnancy, etc)
    - developer milestones (PR, new initative, new roadmap, new framework learned, new tech adopted into a stack, etc.)
    - blogging and social media milestones (X followers / email sign ups, Xth post, certain engagement with a post learnings, any real ship)
    - fitness milestones (X% bodyfat or weight, new PB, practicing a new diet or excercise for a week such as HIIP or hydration tablets)
    - research learnings (read X papers and grokked something important, made a new working prototype that helped me understand something like a Q agent better, thoughts on an emerging movement)
- Challenging society and my industry?
