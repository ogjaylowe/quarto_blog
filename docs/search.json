You need to have it all!\nIf for example, you don‚Äôt agree with the importance of having great physical and spirtual health, then how will your children be healthy?\nYou know best for your family.\nDon‚Äôt trust homeschooling only because I do it and don‚Äôt put your kid into a public school because you don‚Äôt know better. Have an intent behind your action.\nFor everybody else:\nThe fatherhood components to my writing will not always be present and will be designated with a fatherhood tag for those who do not benefit from dad-related content.\nMaybe you have a father present in your life, such as your dad or a relative/friend with children, in which case you can help them out.\nThis blog got started because my wife shares lots of relevant dad content with me and I wanted to share my thoughts and beliefs as they develop. Writing solidifes concepts!\nIf you only benefit from ML developer content‚Äìawesome! Enjoy the content, I will post a lot of it."

    "text": "Why ‚ÄúSovereign‚Äù Tech Dad\nWe live in an era of constant attention-seeking products and government welfare states. To state the obvious logic, if you don‚Äôt have independence from these systems‚Äìyou depend on them.\nIndependence promotes you to take meaningful risks. Get enough of it and your behavior will change to emphasize self-ownership and rational thought grounded in deterministic goals (goodbye fatalists üëã) instead of consumption as a solution.\nIdeally, you should recognize to some degree the importance of globally integrated economies. What happens in China or Europe impacts North America and vice-versa.\nUse emerging digital solutions to put yourself into a location-independent position. You should live and work because you love it there and you get good tax benefits‚Äìnot because you can‚Äôt feed your family if you move 40 miles.\nI want you to benefit from changes on the global scale. Nationalism only works when your side wins, so don‚Äôt pit yourself against the rally when you could instead gain from it."
